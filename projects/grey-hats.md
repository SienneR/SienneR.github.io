As a natural born problem solver and challenge-lover, I immediately knew Grey Hats was the club for me. Throughout each semester, weekly meetings have covered a variety of compelling topics. Grey Hats Club covers topics relevant to cybersecurity and ethical hacking. Among these are common platforms used by or developed by organizations like as the NSA (e.g. metasploit), and a variety of ways to grow your ethical hacking skills. Through Grey Hats meetings as well as individual study through programs like TryHackMe and HackTheBox I have been able to consistently grow my cybersecurity knowledge and ability, and continue to nurture this passion.
