## Generative Artificial Intelligence 

A hot topic in the last year, generative artificial intelligence, aka generative A.I., has had a huge impact on many different aspects of society and the world. While many people fear its power, most of us in the computer science world know very well that it is a long way from its dystopian depiction in media. Although we may not have robots taking over the world any time soon (Age of Ultron is just going to have to wait...), generative A.I. still has quite a bit to offer. With capabilities ranging from workout planning to differential equation calculations, generative A.I. is a tool, but that's about all it is. As with all tools, you must know how to use it correctly for it to be helpful. Unlike many tools however, you must be very careful not to be misled.

### ChatGPT

Although there are many different generative A.I. products available today, my personal experience is almost exclusively with ChatGPT, and therefore the content within this essay is in the context of my work with ChatGPT.

## Spring Board

As a computer science major, I have personally found generative A.I. very helpful in a variety of different subjects. Although it almost never gets the answer exactly right, it can almost always provide a helpful starting point. If you put 100% confidence in generative A.I., you will almost certainly be led astray. However, in order to effectively use generative A.I., there are a few important principals:

### Always Assume its Incorrect

Generative A.I. has advanced enough to where you can use it as a knowledge base. However, in the context of computer science academia, you must always assume the details it gives you are incorrect. In my experience, I have found that about half of the time, if you ask ChatGPT "are you sure?", it will change its answer! Sometimes the first answer is correct, sometimes the second is, and occassionaly, neither is correct! Generative A.I. may certainly serve as an inspiration, but when asking questions with any nuance, you should always follow up your A.I. expedition with good old fashioned research. You are still the better half of Generative A.I., isn't that good news? 

### K.I.S.S. 

The K.I.S.S. (Keep it simple, stupid!) rule is a good principle to adopt in many different contexts. In the context of generative A.I., it means you can pretty much bet that if your knowledge is getting down to the 'nitty-gritty' or very 'in the weeds', you're not going to get helpful answers. For example, if you ask it to write some basic java code, it'll give you a pretty good answer, but if you ask it to design data structures and algorithms for a specific prompt, I'd be willing to bet you you're going to have to do a pretty good amount of rewriting!

## Spring Board (Only!)

Using Generative A.I. can be very helpful, however there are many limitations. If you stick to well known facts, you have pretty good odds of getting dependable answers. However, if you're trying to get really into the 'generative' part, asking for synthesis of complex ideas or advanced analyses, you're better off using it exclusively for inspiration. Generative A.I. is a very good spring board. It can help you start a discussion post, come up with the main ideas for a paper, or even give you a design to help get your brain wheels turning, but (as with all things), you should *not* take its word as the truth and you should *not* stop your digging there.
