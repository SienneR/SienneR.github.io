## Generative Artificial Intelligence 

A hot topic in the last year, generative artificial intelligence, aka generative A.I., has had a huge impact on many different aspects of society and the world. While many people fear its power, most of us in the computer science world know very well that it is a long way from its dystopian depiction in media. Although we may not have robots taking over the world any time soon (Age of Ultron is just going to have to wait...), generative A.I. still has quite a bit to offer. With capabilities ranging from workout planning to differential equation calculations, generative A.I. is a tool, but that's about all it is. As with all tools, you must know how to use it correctly for it to be helpful. Unlike many tools however, you must be very careful not to be misled.

### ChatGPT

Although there are many different generative A.I. products available today, my personal experience is almost exclusively with ChatGPT, and therefore the content within this essay is in the context of my work with ChatGPT.

## Spring Board

As a computer science major, I have personally found generative A.I. very helpful in a variety of different subjects. Although it almost never gets the answer exactly right, it can almost always provide a helpful starting point. If you put 100% confidence in generative A.I., you will almost certainly be led astray. However, in order to effectively use generative A.I., there are a few important principals:

### Always Assume its Incorrect

<img width="200px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../img/ai/brain-ai.jpeg">

Generative A.I. has advanced enough to where you can use it as a knowledge base. However, in the context of computer science academia, you must always assume the details it gives you are incorrect. In my experience, I have found that about half of the time, if you ask ChatGPT "are you sure?", it will change its answer! Sometimes the first answer is correct, sometimes the second is, and occassionaly, neither is correct! Generative A.I. may certainly serve as an inspiration, but when asking questions with any nuance, you should always follow up your A.I. expedition with good old fashioned research. You are still the better half of Generative A.I., isn't that good news? 

### K.I.S.S. 

The K.I.S.S. (Keep it simple, stupid!) rule is a good principle to adopt in many different contexts. In the context of generative A.I., it means you can pretty much bet that if your knowledge is getting down to the 'nitty-gritty' or very 'in the weeds', you're not going to get helpful answers. For example, if you ask it to write some basic java code, it'll give you a pretty good answer, but if you ask it to design data structures and algorithms for a specific prompt, I'd be willing to bet you you're going to have to do a pretty good amount of rewriting!

## Spring Board (Only!)

Using Generative A.I. can be very helpful, however there are many limitations. If you stick to well known facts, you have pretty good odds of getting dependable answers. However, if you're trying to get really into the 'generative' part, asking for synthesis of complex ideas or advanced analyses, you're better off using it exclusively for inspiration. Generative A.I. is a very good spring board. It can help you start a discussion post, come up with the main ideas for a paper, or even give you a design to help get your brain wheels turning, but (as with all things), you should *not* take its word as the truth and you should *not* stop your digging there. 

# ICS 314 Course Involvement

### ICS 314 

ICS 314 is a software development course. Over the semester, we have covered a wide range of topics to include JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Meteor, MongoDB, and more! In coordination with the weekly material, there is a particular pedigogy to the course. Each week, you have a "WOD", or workout of the day, where you implement whatever you have been working on in a small, timed project. 

### Experience WODs

In experience WODs, generative A.I. was moderately helpful. As with many A.I. queries, you have to know what question to ask. For example, when working with the Underscore javascript library, you can give chatGPT a prompt of what you want to do, and it can pretty reliably give you a solution function. For the experience WODs however, instructor videos were also provided. I found it much more helpful to watch the video and then solve it myself a seperate time or in a seperate context, as this allows you to understand how experienced professionals go about solving it. The "I need X, so I will look for Y" is very helpful in learning a new process and how to filter a large range of information into exactly what you want. 

### In Class Practice WODs and In Class WODs

For In Class Practice WODs (and almost identically, In Class WODs), the helpfulness of generative A.I. depended greatly on the context of the WOD. For example, with basic javascript, HTML, and CSS, you can almost certainly get the right answer spit out at you if you try enough times. You can copy and paste your code in, if you have an error, and chatGPT will tell you some things to try to fix it. While I do not have a definitive percentage, with topics such as the aforementioned ones, you have an about 95% chance of being able to have generative A.I. completely create, or atleast solve errors, within a specific task. 

However, when it came to more complex and interrelated concepts, such as using MongoDB with Meteor and using React with Meteor, ChatGPT is almost completely unhelpful. While it can give you some 'skeletons' to build onto, they're almost always really poor solutions. For example, just today I tried to have ChatGPT create a button which interacts with a custom Collection. The result ChatGPT gave was not only incorrect, but convoluded and poorly organized. 

### Essays

For Essays or any writing synthesis, I have found ChatGPT to be a very poor substitute for actual writing. Even on my worst days, I'm able to explain a concept more eloquently and in detail than ChatGPT. In the context of ICS 314, I haven't used generative A.I. for any essays. I have used ChatGPT to create discussion posts for other classes, however have found that without a single exception, I have had to greatly modify the provided output in order to create an actual post. I would say, generative A.I. has an essay IQ slightly below an exceedingly average individual. 

### Final Project 

Generative A.I., namely ChatGPT, is not very good with Meteor + React + MongoDB. I have tried asking it to create code to work with a database, and it does not do well at all. Any time you want ChatGPT to work with multiple files, even if you copy and paste the involved files directly in the prompt, it gets very confused and is largely unhelpful. Despite this, you can get some helpful information if you break it down...like *really* far down. But, the information is going to be outdated and you're still going to spend a considerable amount of time combing though documentation. 

### Learning a Concept/Tutorial 

If its simple, you're solid. ChatGPT can handle explanation of simple concepts really well. It can identify the relationships between two components, or explain how two things interact. I have asked ChatGPT to give an answer for a certain topic, and then asked "why?", and it almost always gives an understandable explanation. A good rule of thumb for learning concepts is that if there are (shorter) youtube videos explaining it, ChatGPT can probably do better. If you have to dig really deep into youtube, or [Abdul Bari](https://www.youtube.com/@abdul_bari) has a video for you, Abdul can do it better. 

### Questions 

Simple questions are great for ChatGPT. However, I use ChatGPT as my first go-to for any question, so if its puzzling me enough to need to ask it in smart-questions or in class, ChatGPT has already failed quite a few times. ChatGPT does not do well with open ended or complex questions. You have to break it down! If you can break your question down into many smaller questions, ChatGPT can usually help. I personally rarely struggle with this, however many students often do not know what they need to know, so here ChatGPT would be largely unhelpful. 

### Coding Examples 

For simple code, ChatGPT can definitely do it for you! Especially if you ask it for specific examples or give it a prompt to solve and say "use X", ChatGPT can absolutely solve your problem. In contexts such as entry level javascript or libraries such as underscore, you don't even have to think twice, generative A.I. knows what it's doing here! 

### Explaining and Writing Code

If it can write it, it can explain it. If you have a solution already and want it to be explained, you've got a 90% chance of getting a high quality explanation, as long as you're not working with many interrelated files. I have rarely encountered an explanation from ChatGPT that was not enough to gain a working knowledge of the code and be able to synthesize a similar solution from scratch. You do need to be careful though, as sometimes ChatGPT will break conventions, create redundant code, or not include somewhat necessary elements (proper error checking, for example). With JavaScript, Java, C, and C++, I have had very positive experiences asking ChatGPT to code things for me, however exclusively when there are few files involved. 

### Documenting Code 

Generative A.I. does not do a great job with documentation. I have found that it generally explains things that are not necessary to explain or excludes important concepts. Although it does comment almost all code it generates, you will almost certainly need to be able to understand the code it creates and then go create your own commentary. Also, it does not follow conventions, and you will need to implement these yourself. 

### Quality Assurance

A thousand times yes! I cannot count the number of times I have pasted problematic code into ChatGPT and gotten a fix implemented within 10 minutes! This is by far one of my favorite uses for ChatGPT, as once I have checked over my code a few times and am not able to find a problem, I get "concentration blind", where I sometimes miss silly little (important) things like commas, misspellings, or brackets. 

# Impact on Learning and Understanding

ChatGPT has had an overwhelmingly positive influence on my learning and understanding in a variety of contexts. If you can break it down, it can help you. It is certainly not a substitute for human instruction, nor is it a substitute for good old fashioned "grinding it out", however it will almost always make the process quicker. In fact, it is so helpful that my first resource for a problem is almost always ChatGPT. It is not advanced enough to solve all your problems or create solutions the way humans can, but it can give you a strong nudge in the right direction. Showing you where to look and what you might want to look for is a significant amount of the battle, and ChatGPT can consistently shine a flashlight to the dark path (or if not, it can light a candle).
