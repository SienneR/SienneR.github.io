## Generative Artificial Intelligence 

A hot topic in the last year, generative artificial intelligence, aka generative A.I., has had a huge impact on many different aspects of society and the world. While many people fear its power, most of us in the computer science world know very well that it is a long way from its dystopian depiction in media. Although we may not have robots taking over the world any time soon (Age of Ultron is just going to have to wait...), generative A.I. still has quite a bit to offer. With capabilities ranging from workout planning to differential equation calculations, generative A.I. is a tool, but that's about all it is. As with all tools, you must know how to use it correctly for it to be helpful. Unlike many tools however, you must be very careful not to be misled.
