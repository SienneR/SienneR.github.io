  User Interface Frameworks provide a great deal of possibilities for the implementer. Due to all of the options and tools provided, they may take some getting used to. However, the time investment is well worth-while, as UI frameworks are vital tools in software and web development. There are many reasons UI interfaces can be preferred over raw HTML and CSS, including rapid development, consistency, responsive design, community support, cross browser compatibility, and more!

## Don't Reinvent the Wheel! 

There are so many different things to consider when creating software. To name just a few, the device the user has, what browser, and the size of their screen. Accounting for each of these differences would be time consuming. Additionally, you don't have a library of tools ready to use, such as tables, icons, forms, and etc. You could sit around creating them each individually, but odds are you're not goingt to do it quite as well as the published library, and its likely going to take quite a little while. Knowing HTML and CSS is absolutely necessary and helpful, however, you're going to be writing quite a bit of it if you're doing everything analog. Especially with languages where you write so extensively and its easy to get lost in a sea of div tags, you're going to want to simplify when you can. 

## The UI Framework

What actually is a UI Framework? It's basically a library of pre-written tools for you to use. Common elements of webpages are created, and put in the library for you to access whenever you would like! Icons? You got it! Tables? You got it! Forms? Yep those too! With consistent styling and formatting and a great deal of pre-created elements, your life just got a whole lot easier and more efficient.

## ESLint with IntellijIDEA

In the last week, I have begun working with ESLint and the AirBnB standard set within IntellijIDEA development. The first few times you get an error because you've got an extra space or maybe you're missing a space, it's quite annoying. But that quickly passes, and it becomes habit to write that way in less than 100 lines of code, or in my case, 57 lines. Point being, it is not a colossal inconvenience to adapt a coding standard into your writing. 

Coding standards can actually help you learn a new language more quickly! It's well organized, you know what to expect, and you get a feel for the structure of the writing. If you google code examples for a certain language or problem, you could see 100 different versions of the same code. With a coding standard, that number quickly reduces, and it allows you to focus on the actual language, not the *accent* people speak it with. To extend this metaphor further, sometimes a strong enough accent can make a language incomprehensible. 

In a classroom setting specifically, a coding standard can greatly benefit the student. Now when an instructor reads your code, it will be considerably easier for them to quickly and efficiently recognize any errors which exist. They don't need to spend time analyzing the weird ways people who are learning something for the first time might write something out, and therefore can give better feedback. Simplifying the work for your instructor is a great benefit to the student. If your code for a simple (and to them likely boring), program is all over the place, they're unlikely to want to endure the mind-numbing work of trying to find an issue with your work (other than the work itself, haha!). I know I probably wouldn't. But it doesn't just benefit the student in regard to instructor feedback. With a coding standard, you can share work with your peers and collaborate in a time effective manner. They will understand your work, and you can understand yours. Now you've got two efficient brains working on some problem you may be having, instead of one!

## Why Wouldn't You? 

With all the benefits a coding standard provides, why wouldn't you adapt one appropriate for your community? You have no problem using formulas in a math class, doesn't it make sense to be formulaic in a field based almost entirely on math? As Leonardo Da Vinci could attest, you may be able to think and create in a manner well ahead of your time, but if you write your ideas backwards and in shorthand others cannot understand, you are unlikely to gain the traction you otherwise might be able to. 

There is a great deal of benefit that a coding standard provides to both the writer and their community. The only argument against a coding standard is that it creates a temporary annoyance. But if that is enough to deter you from the rewards of community involvement and understanding, you have likely chosen the wrong field. It doesn't matter who you are or how smart you are, in the world of coding and programming, you will inevitably need to work with others. You might get a 'free-spirited' coworker here and there, but odds are even they are going to want to be able to understand what you're trying to say.
