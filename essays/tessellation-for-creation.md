*"To understand is to perceive patterns" - Isaiah Berlin*

Everything in the world is made up of patterns. From behavior to math, science, language, and even nature, everything around us is made up of or can be predicted by patterns. Implementation and understanding of patterns builds the world around us. Patterns affect every aspect of our lives, including software design.

## Computers and Patterns

Almost every aspect of computer science is just applied mathematics. And as is well known, math is largely just the discovery and development of naturally occuring patterns. From basic binary to RSA encryption, computers rely heavily on patterns to create and manipulate our every day experiences. Some more examples of computers putting patterns to work are: 

* Algorithms (literally - defined patterns for computer behavior)
* Data Structures (organized patterns for storing information)
* Logic Gates (patterns for computer behavior based on conditions)
* Machine Learning (advanced pattern recognition)
* Graphics (mathematical equations to make patterns look pretty)
* Network Protocols (communication between computers based on patterns)
* Coding Languages (patterns to make other patterns)
* And many more!

Obviously, computers use patterns to perform practically every function. I would be willing to bet, that you could define any process a computer can complete using the word "pattern", or atleast in the context of the word "pattern". Largely because computers are just a cool application of math, you can understand everything just by having a really good understanding of patterns.

## Software Design Patterns

There are three main types of software design patterns. Creational patterns, which dictate rules for object creation, structural patterns, which focus on composition of classes or objects, and behavioral patterns, which address how objects interact and communicate. Each plays an important part in software design, as it not only organizes software well, but also allows many developers to work together with an understanding of how to implement the intended goal. Design patterns allow everyone to stay on the same page as to what is going on in the code and give abstract rules to the design process. The main benefits of software design patterns are reusability, scalability, maintainability, and testability. 

The key principals of all software design patterns are 

* Problem-Solution Context (addresses recurring problems experienced by past developers)
* Abstraction by Encapsulation (technicalities are encapsulated, allowing higher-level concept implementation)
* Flexibility and Adaptability (patterns can be customized to suit the requirements of a given project)
* Common Vocabulary (makes communication between developers more succint and understandable)

Each of these components work together to embody and define software design patterns. Software design patterns are meant to aid the software development process, and with continuous improvement and evolution, these patterns have an overwhelmingly positive impact on the develpment community. Some examples of well known software design patterns are: 

* Singleton Pattern
* Observer Pattern
* Factory Method Pattern
* Decorator Pattern
* Adapter Pattern
* Command Pattern

In the development process, a developer or team of developers may implement a range of software design patterns. Many are taught as best practice, and as a result aren't even a topic of discussion. Overall, software design patterns greatly assist the software development community by making code more cohesive, understandable, manipulitable, maintainable, and scalable. Although many of the patterns that are well defined would likely have come to be standard practice without explicit enumeration, the benefit remains in that an abstract topic has been made into a clear standard, allowing developers to advance as a whole.
