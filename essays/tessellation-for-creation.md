*"To understand is to perceive patterns" - Isaiah Berlin*

Everything in the world is made up of patterns. From behavior to math, science, language, and even nature, everything around us is made up of or can be predicted by patterns. Implementation and understanding of patterns builds the world around us. Patterns affect every aspect of our lives, including software design.

Almost every aspect of computer science is just applied mathematics. And as is well known, math is largely just the discovery and development of naturally occuring patterns. 

## Software Design Patterns 


## Implementation of Software Design Patterns
