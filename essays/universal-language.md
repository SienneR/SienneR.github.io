  Growing up, I was always a fan of math and science. I was almost always pretty good at it too! But as all children do, I sometimes would have issues with a particular math assignment here and there. I would get all upset about how in these cases, it didn't just come naturally to me and I had to get allll worked up over it. My mother, attempting to reassure me that my efforts were not in vain, would always say, "Sienne, math is the universal lanaguge. It doesn't matter where you go or what languages they speak there, you will always be able to speak to people in math!". Naturally, I would argue that there are quite a few ideas you cannot get across with math, but the point remains, that there is a great deal of value in standardization and a universally agreed upon set of rules. 

##  You're Only As Good As Your Communication

You could be the smartest person in the whole world, but it wouldn't matter if other people could not understand you. Likewise, you could write an amazing program, but it would have a limited effect it others could not understand your code, or could not contribute to your work. You might be pretty darn good at coding, but you won't be around forever... 

## Necessity of Coding Standards  




## What about Me? 

There are no bounds to what I want to learn. Thanks to the computer scientists who came before me, there aren't any bounds for what I *can* learn either! Professors, advisors, industry professionals, family members, everyone just wants to know what you want to specialize in. "Sure you like it all, but what do you like *more*??" I like learning more. I like solving puzzles more. I like creating something out of nothing more. Well thank goodness too because I certainly picked the right field for it. Not to mention, everything in computer science is connected. Once you learn how to code in one language, you can pick up fluency in another one in less than a day, I mean shoot, I just did this past Friday. If you've "got it" with computer science, like really understand a certain topic, you can sneeze and accidentally pick up another! Don't get too close...it might be contagious... 

But seriously, I am so excited to learn software development. For ICS 314, we haven't even hardly started the content, and I went from stumbling around GitHub like I didn't know which way was up, to creating a whole website in just one weekend. I'm especially excited to be using tools that I keep seeing in job descriptions in applications, like Meteor, React, IntellijIDEA, and so many more. I cannot wait to learn how the process of actually creating software from the ground up works. Don't get me wrong, all the math classes were real fun, but i'm so happy to be doing work that resembles what i'll be doing in the field in a short time! There is nothing more exciting than creation. You've got a problem? Ugh, its worse, there's nothing out there that solves it for you! Well good thing you're an ICS major, because guess what, looks like you're fixing it.

## And the World Won't Wait for You Either

We are continuously growing and changing. As people, as a community, as a profession, and even as a world. You know, in the third grade I had a teacher who wouldn't let me use a calculator. I of course thought, well we have this magnificent tool, we already learned the basics and *can* do it without, why not use this awesome technology? "When you grow up and are walking around town, you're not going to be carrying a calculator everywhere with you!", boy oh boy I bet she feels pretty silly now. 

Our only limit is our imagination. Even recently, another thing most of us wouldn't have dreamed up, became commonplace! You can now chat with a website, who seems to know way more about your differential equations class than you do! Obviously, there have been some pretty problematic things with A.I. in the past, but there's always a learning curve with these types of things. There is so much left to discover and develop. Learning the tools and methodologies to move ourselves forward as a society (and get an A in ICS 314) is just the first step! I cannot wait to be part of the professional computer science community, contributing to the innovations and society of tomorrow!
