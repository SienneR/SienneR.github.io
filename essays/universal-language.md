  Growing up, I was always a fan of math and science. I was almost always pretty good at it too! But as all children do, I sometimes would have issues with a particular math assignment here and there. I would get all upset about how in these cases, it didn't just come naturally to me and I had to get allll worked up over it. My mother, attempting to reassure me that my efforts were not in vain, would always say, "Sienne, math is the universal lanaguge. It doesn't matter where you go or what languages they speak there, you will always be able to speak to people in math!". Naturally, I would argue that there are quite a few ideas you cannot get across with math, but the point remains, that there is a great deal of value in standardization and a universally agreed upon set of rules. 

##  You're Only As Good As Your Communication

You could be the smartest person in the whole world, but it wouldn't matter if other people could not understand you. Likewise, you could write an amazing program, but it would have a limited effect it others could not understand your code, or could not contribute to your work. You might be pretty darn good at coding, but you won't be around forever... 

## Necessity of Coding Standards  

Coding standards are a vital part of the development community. There may be tons of coding languages and a great deal of different coding standards, but the organization and rules which govern a certain coding standard are a vital part to the development of programs and code everywhere. Without codings standards, programs would be considerably more complex, difficult to read, and therefore also a greater challenge to maintain and add upon! Adhering to a set of structural norms allows others to understand what you're trying to do, maintain the goal, and build upon it to create an even more adventageous result. Even if you are more advanced than your peers (or simply under the impression that you are), two brains are practically guaranteed to be better than one. And odds are, there is more than one other person who can understand you if you're using a coding standard! Not only is using a coding standard a vital part of creating code, but it allows you to unleash the power of the nerd community on your work!

## And the World Won't Wait for You Either

We are continuously growing and changing. As people, as a community, as a profession, and even as a world. You know, in the third grade I had a teacher who wouldn't let me use a calculator. I of course thought, well we have this magnificent tool, we already learned the basics and *can* do it without, why not use this awesome technology? "When you grow up and are walking around town, you're not going to be carrying a calculator everywhere with you!", boy oh boy I bet she feels pretty silly now. 

Our only limit is our imagination. Even recently, another thing most of us wouldn't have dreamed up, became commonplace! You can now chat with a website, who seems to know way more about your differential equations class than you do! Obviously, there have been some pretty problematic things with A.I. in the past, but there's always a learning curve with these types of things. There is so much left to discover and develop. Learning the tools and methodologies to move ourselves forward as a society (and get an A in ICS 314) is just the first step! I cannot wait to be part of the professional computer science community, contributing to the innovations and society of tomorrow!
