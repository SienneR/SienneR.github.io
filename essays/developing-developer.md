Software development is a skill which requires expertise in a large variety of areas. In my software development course, we have learned a great many tools, from a new coding language, development environments, and coding standards, to ethics, project management, and even quality assurance tools. 

There were many valuable lessons taught in my software development course, culminating in [this awesome app](). We learned how to iteratively design web applications in a flexible manner, using Agile Project Management principals. Specifically, we used the Issue Driven Project Management, [IDPM](https://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f23/morea/project-management/reading-guidelines-idpm.html) guidelines to effectively collaborate and build an application as a group. We studied [design patterns](https://sienner.github.io/essays/tessellation-for-creation.html) through practical implementations in many different aspects of the course. We built a great toolset, including react, bootstrap, and meteor.
