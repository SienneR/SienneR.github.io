*JavaScript: The Wild Wild West of Coding*

If Java is the first coding language you learn, which is the case for many computer science students, learning JavaScript might be a pretty big culture shock. In Java, the rules are very strict and very clear. You name everything a very specific way, you have to create functions (or rather - methods) a very specific way, and if you miss a tiny detail, miswrite a name, or don't have very accurate tabs on your types, methods, return values, etc, it could very well be that the whole project falls apart! Just recently, I took on JavaScript...and honestly, i'm a little offended...

## Types? LET it be! 

When learning to code with Java, the amount of hours you will spend chasing down a technicality are considerable. Perhaps you tried to get doubles to Doubles the wrong way, tried to access something incorrectly, labelled something incorrectly, it could be any number of hundreds of things! Theres a bunch of little rules, that aren't always explicitly stated, that you become very familiar with. 

With JavaScript, you just *let* it be. All you need to know to create a variable, is var, let, and const (and since ES6, not really var anymore!). With functions, you don't even need to list a return type! Return whatever you want! Its all groovy, man. Dynamic typing is a huge adjustment for a Java accustomed, trained stickler for specificalities!

## Functions, Objects, Equality, Oh My! 

JavaScript has a really fascinating way of doing its functions. In older versions, you just go ahead and write the keyword function, the input parameters, if any, then do what you need to do in the body. Return value or not, and if you change your mind later on, thats okay too! No huge disastrous re-arrangements necessary. With ES6, theres a whole new way to write functions. Now functions are even more streamlined, with arrow syntax. You can even write in default values, incase you want to use a function that has parameters without passing anything in! 

Objects in JavaScript, when transitioning from Java, are also a whole new world. You can access their properties with . (dot) notation or [] (bracket) notation! You can add to objects using either notation, and you can even create nested objects! This seems as though it could get messy if you're not keeping good mental tabs on your objects and their properties, but can also make the object manipulation and accessing properties much more streamlined. While there are certain instances in which chosing . over [] or vis versa is recommended or required (e.g. [] notation for dynamic properties), there are many times in which they can be used interchangeably. How fun is that? 

Equality in JavaScript...wait do you mean strictly equals or just equals? We have gained a new level of distinction! As usual = is just assignment. However now we have == and ===. == is 'loose' equals, or equals after type conversion. For example the string 5 is equal to the int 5. === is 'strict' equals, where the string 5 and the int 5 are not the same. For my fellow Java-Heads, == in Java is === in JavaScript! Naturally, there are parrallel statements for the not equals evaluation. 


## Theory to Practice. What about WODs?  

With all of the 'bendy' qualities of JavaScript, it is impossible not to wonder about the large scale implementation of its programs. Its everywhere! Javascript's 'bendiness' makes it an extremely versatile language, being used in both front-end (web interfaces, applications, etc) and back-end (Node.js, etc) environments. This also makes it a convenient option for software development! You don't need to switch languages, or 'translate', when working on a specific project. You can do the whole thing in JavaScript! Not only is it great for the tech-nerds like us on the creation end, but JavaScript is also compatible with all major web browsers, so our non-tech-nerd friends who may view or use our work have access! And we can thank the folks at ECMA for standardizations and improvements on a fairly regular basis! 

Trying to learn JavaScript, or any other software engineering tool? How about a WOD! A weekly workout instead of a big ole project, to get you accustomed and fluent with the new learning material. The plus side of WODs is that you can get working experience with a wide range of topics and gain atleast a little bit of mastery with a new thing every week. The down side is you don't get to go super in depth with your knowledge or task. Personally, just sitting at my computer and diving into the deep abyss of a big coding project, hours on end, puzzling it all together, getting lost in the wonderful maze of problem solving, streamlining, and eventually finishing, a project has always been my favourite part of this degree. So, while I certainly will miss the creative freedom and size of projects that is curtailed by a time limit and quick pace, I can see the value and appreciate the experience of tackling something new each week! And even most ICS majors aren't fans of huge, difficult coding projects, so this method should certainly be very popular. 

## Now what?

While I may be a novice right now, I am so excited to gain fluency in JavaScript and other software development tools this semester. It definitely takes some adjusting when moving from an almost exclusively Java background, but as I become more skilled, I believe that the things that 'offend' my current coding beliefs will very quickly become some of the most powerful tools in my arsenal! 

Already I can see how much power and influence JavaScript has. And so many functionalities! Its definitely a land of no laws compared to java. But while it may be the Wild Wild West when it comes to some of the rules, as we know from the success of our geographic Wild Wild West as well as Javascript's ubiquitousness, sometimes thinking outside the box is quite effective!
