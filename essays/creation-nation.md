*"The true sign of intelligence is not knowledge but imagination" - Albert Einstein*

Pick a problem that the world faces today. No really, pick *any* problem in the whole world. I can guarantee you, the problem you just picked can be greatly assisted, or even solved, by software development. In the modern world, we have more than we have ever had. More resources, more knowledge, more connectivity, more wealth, but also more problems, more hunger, more hostility, more strife. 

##  The Computer Science Nerd

Computer Science students and professionals often get a bad wrap for being antisocial and disconnected from the world. While that may be true for some of us, for the others, there is nothing further from the truth. Technology has always been the driving force of civilization. In a world where most of your connections and experiences are documented or created by technology, where your basic resources like electricity, water, lighting, food, information, and even healthcare are managed by technology, is it really possible to contribute to a greater society without being technologically fluent? Without having the ability to understand technology enough to be able to manipulate it for the better? 

So maybe we do get a bad wrap, but computer science students are literally shaping the world of tomorrow. There is no aspect of modern living, not one, that is not heavily influenced by computers or the tech world. 

## Put Some Skin in the Game 

Ok, so i've talked a big talk. I've told you all about how computer science students are the movers and makers of our progressing society. But how are we actually doing that? Maybe we should google it...ah yes! *Google*. Theres just one enourmous example of how computer science flipped society on its head and gave it more! Every operating system or computer you've ever used, every app you've opened, every text you've typed out on that mini computer you keep in your pocket, wouldn't have been possible without software developers. 


## What about Me? 

There are no bounds to what I want to learn. Thanks to the computer scientists who came before me, there aren't any bounds for what I *can* learn either! Professors, advisors, industry professionals, family members, everyone just wants to know what you want to specialize in. "Sure you like it all, but what do you like *more*??" I like learning more. I like solving puzzles more. I like creating something out of nothing more. Well thank goodness too, because I certainly picked the right field for it. Not to mention, everything in computer science is connected. Once you learn how to code in one language, you can pick up fluency in another one in less than a day, I mean shoot, I just did this past Friday. If youve "got it" with computer science, like really understand a certain topic, you can sneeze and accidentally pick up another! Dont get too close...it might be contagious... 

But seriously, I am so excited to learn software development. For ICS 314, we haven't even hardly started the content, and I went from stumbling around GitHub like I didn't know which way was up, to creating a whole website in just one weekend. I'm especially excited to be using tools that I keep seeing in job descriptions in applications, like Meteor, React, IntellijIDEA, and so many more. I cannot wait to learn how the process of actually creating software from the ground up works. Don't get me wrong, all the math classes were real fun, but i'm so happy to be doing work that resembles what i'll be doing in the field in a short time! There is nothing more exciting than creation. You've got a problem? Ugh, its worse, there's nothing out there that solves it for you! Well good thing you're an ICS major, because guess what, looks like you're fixing it.

## And the World Won't Wait for You Either

We are continuously growing and changing. As people, as a community, as a profession, and even as a world. You know, in the third grade I had a teacher who wouldn't let me use a calculator. I ofcourse thought, well we have this magnificent tool, we already learned the basics and *can* do it without, why not use this awesome technology? "When you grow up and are walking around town, you're not going to be carrying a calculator everywhere with you!", boy oh boy I bet she feels pretty silly now. 

Our only limit is our imagination. Even recently, another thing most of us wouldn't have dreamed up, became commonplace! You can now chat with a website, who seems to know way more about your differential equations class than you do! Obviously, there have been some pretty problematic things with A.I. in the past, but there's always a learning curve with these types of things. There is so much left to discover and develop. Learning the tools and methodologies to move ourselves forward as a society (and get an A in ICS 314) is just the first step! I cannot wait to be part of the professional computer science community, contributing to the innovations and society of tomorrow!
